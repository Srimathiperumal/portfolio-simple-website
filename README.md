**Portfolio Website Description**

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site is designed to showcase my skills and provide an easy way for visitors to contact me. Built using simple HTML and basic CSS, the site consists of two main pages: the Home page and the Contact Form page. Here is an overview of these key sections and features:

### Home Page
The Home page serves as the primary hub of my portfolio. It features a welcoming introduction and a brief overview of who I am and what I do. Key components of the Home page include:

- **Introduction Section:** A concise introduction that highlights my background, professional focus, and passion.
- **About Me:** A short summary of my education, experience, and key skills, giving visitors a snapshot of my professional journey.
- **Key Projects:** Highlighted sections for a few key projects, including a project title, a brief description, and the technologies used.
- **Skills:** A list of my technical and soft skills, categorized for easy reference, with simple icons or graphics to visually represent my capabilities.

### Contact Form Page
The Contact Form page is dedicated to providing an easy way for visitors to get in touch with me. It features a simple and user-friendly contact form. Key components of the Contact Form page include:

- **Contact Form:** A form that allows visitors to send me a message directly from the website. The form typically includes fields for the visitor's name, email address, subject, and message.
- **Contact Information:** Additional contact details, such as my email address and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, ensuring multiple ways for visitors to reach out.

**HTML and CSS Highlights:**

- **HTML:** The structure is clean and semantic, using elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`. This helps improve the readability and accessibility of the content.
  
- **CSS:** The design employs basic CSS to create a visually appealing and cohesive look. Key properties such as `margin`, `padding`, `font-family`, `color`, and `background-color` are used to style the elements. Simple Flexbox techniques ensure the layout is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.

This streamlined portfolio website is designed to provide a clear and effective presentation of my skills and an easy way for visitors to contact me, ensuring a pleasant and functional experience for all users.
